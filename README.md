## Vancouver Open Data Day Challenge
*What VODDay Challenge is your project focusing on? (See the [2018 VODday Challenges](https://www.opendatabc.ca/pages/vodday-2018-vancouver-open-data-day-hackathon#challenges).)*

Opioid Overdose Crisis, Harm Reduction and Mental Health



## Prototype Problem Statement


We want to modernize getting help. Using Mobile tech we want to cut the time it takes
to get help on situations that are plaguing our society. From overdoeses to heart attacks
we want to make it easy for someone to get the help they need. 

## Protoype Summary

Our approach was simple. We used a mobile app to allow users to track the nearest Naloxone kits, AED,
police, hospital, and ambulanance. 


## Open Data Sets

### What Open Data Sets Did You Use?

 We used Vancouver Open Data Sets
 
 Pieces of the open data were not there, so we used temp data we still pulled from Vancouver
 for the AED we pulled the data from the map hosted on vancouver.ca. We used the data that is
 populated by the map and created a json data set which we use to track the AED.
 Fire stations we used the fire halls open data source
 the rest were randomly selected from the Vancouver Open data set as demonstrations of what it 
 could look like.
 
 

### What Open Data Sets Do You Still Need?

Ambulance Stations - 

Automated External Defibrillator - Where public and private are located with details
of exactly where it is located at the location. With that you could help out someone in
need in a short amount of time just by knowing exactly where it is.

Naloxone Kits - Same as the AED above this could be highly useful if the data was easily accessible

Hospitals - A place where you have the data for hospitals and their type and location stored so
if someone needs help they can find the nearest help needed without having to take the time to 
search for themselves.

Police Stations - Again easily accessible help if someone needs it. Not having a place where
the data is easily access can cause issues if someone has to look up and sort through 
for help

## Next Steps
We are working with the New West Minster Police department.
We need proper data, and time to finish developing and presenting the solution as an application
